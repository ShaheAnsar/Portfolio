    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Doing an MS in CS with a BS in EE. I enjoy working with hands-on anything. Embedded engineering is ideal for that - I work with code that runs at the lowest possible level and interact with electronics all day long.
	There is an endless variety of things to do and learn in this field too - from motor control to Tiny ML to signal processing. If you think you have a problem that sounds similar then I might be your ideal person!</p>

    <h2>Cool stuff I do</h2>

	<div class="project">
		<h3>Bootloader with Redundancy (Embedded Systems)</h3>
		<p>Divides flash into application and backup regions. Automatically switches to backup if corruption occurs. Supports UART firmware updates with bare-metal code. Thought it would be fun - alas I regret to say it was a boring project to finish <a href="https://github.com/ShaheAnsar/STM32-Bootloader">View project</a></p>
	</div>

	<div class="project">
		<h3>x86 Kernel (Programming)</h3>
		<p>A simple x86 kernel written in C and assembly. I made this to learn how a basic x86 OS works, and wanted to go further than most 16-bit implementations, so I went 32-bit. Includes drivers for PIT, keyboard, VGA, and more. Uses GRUB. <a href="https://github.com/ShaheAnsar/ProtocolBroccoli">View project</a></p>
	</div>

	<div class="project">
		<h3>4-bit CPU in Logisim (Computer Architecture)</h3>
		<p>Graphical digital circuit of a simple CPU using a RISC style ISA. Was done as a learning project to understand how simple CPUs worked. A previous project on a Z80 (and the simplicity of building a system around it) was the inspiration.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="project">
		<h3>STM32 Development Board (PCB Design, PCB Etching)</h3>
		<p>1-layer board for STM32F030K6T6, designed for home etching using KiCAD. JLCPCB is cool but nothing beats having a PCB in an hour made out of components I already have on hand. <a href="https://github.com/ShaheAnsar/stm32f030k6t6_1lyr">View project</a></p>
	</div>

	<div class="project">
		<h3>Function Generator (Embedded Systems)</h3>
		<p>Controls an AD9833 waveform generator using register-level STM32 code. I used it as a make-shift function generator for audio circuits and filters. <a href="https://github.com/ShaheAnsar/funcgen">View project</a></p>
	</div>

	<div class="project">
		<h3>Heated Etchant Bath (Embedded Systems)</h3>
		<p>On-off temperature controller for a chemical etchant bath. Wanted to see how I'd fare with a safety critical design - you do not want to overheat the etchant. I used a heater and a relay to heat the waterbath. The etchant is kept in the water bath. The delta is carefully monitored and switched off if it gets close to a set limit. One hiccup - the display I was using had a weird non-standard version of I2C that the Atmega I used does not support, so I had to bit-bang the "I2C" display. I hate I2C with a passion but the bit-banging was fun. <a href="https://github.com/ShaheAnsar/EtchantHeatBath">View project</a></p> 
	</div>

	<div class="project">
		<h3>Guitar Amplifier (Signal Processing, Power Amplification)</h3>
		<p>Opamp-based front-end with effects and TDA2030 power amplifier. Implements distortion and 3-band EQ. My cheap amplifier broke, so I designed a simple one instead using parts I had on hand. Lesson - always have a bunch of audio components on hand.
	</div>

	<div class="project">
		<h3>3 Stage Planetary Gearbox for a NEMA17</h3>
		<p>As part of building small robots, I wanted something that would be simple, cheap and most importantly for me - something I can build when the inspiration hits. So I built this. It was incredibly fun since I had only designed
		simple gear trains before this. It was my first go at a proper gearbox. I wanted strength and repairability to be a highlight (Yes, repairability, because plastic gears). All rotating components do so on small ball bearings.
		To improve the strength of the gears, I decided to put screws in them - an increase in weight in exchanges for higher strength. The failures shifted from sheared layers to sheared teeth with a higher loading capacity. The stages 
		can be stacked one on top of each other to increase the reduction, but the current limitation is the way the sun gear is coupled to the shaft - it slips under higher reduction ratios.
		The CAD file is not very well organized, so please go easy one me lol <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/628725548aec2925c6257bde/w/74453b49c7e9cc60e4555859/e/285256c12445cb8614b2746f?renderMode=0&uiState=68762ff538acdb4d2a5fd140">View project</a></p>
	</div>
	<div class="project">
		<h3>RGBDSLAM (SLAM, Sensor Fusion)</h3>
		<p>Used Kinect V2 with FPFH matching for visual odometry. Graph optimization with GTSAM. It was my first research paper implementation - found an old ICRA paper that explained how RGBDSLAM worked, and I wanted to see if I could build it. It was the reason for my jump into robotics research. <a href="https://github.com/ShaheAnsar/RGBDSLAM">View project</a></p>
	</div>

	<div class="project">
		<h3>Bayes Net SLAM Optimizer (SLAM, Sensor Fusion, Optimization)</h3>
		<p>Constructs and optimizes a Bayes Net to solve SLAM. Includes a custom Gauss-Newton optimizer. Factor Graphs support in progress. I built this to understand how some of the frameworks I used for my original RBGDSLAM project worked. <a href="https://github.com/ShaheAnsar/2DSlamBackend">View project</a></p>
	</div>

	<div class="project">
		<h3>Rasterized Renderer (Computer Graphics, Image Processing)</h3>
		<p>Software implementation of the graphics pipeline. Includes line/triangle rendering, depth testing, alpha blending, and clipping. Like most of my projects, I just wanted to know how calls I make through OpenGL are acctually processed. <a href="https://github.com/ShaheAnsar/toyrenderer">View project</a></p>
	</div>

	<div class="project">
		<h3>OpenGL Rendering Engine (Computer Graphics, Image Processing)</h3>
		<p>Implements Phong, Blinn-Phong, and NPR shading. Features image filters. Found enough time on my hands after the project so I went ahead and implemented a simple ray-tracer completely in compute shaders just to see how well it would work. CG is still, to this date, the coolest of stuff that computers made possible. <a href="https://github.com/ShaheAnsar/toyrenderer">View project</a></p>
